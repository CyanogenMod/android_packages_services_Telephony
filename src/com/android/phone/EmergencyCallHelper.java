     * - Listen for the service state change event telling us the radio has come up
     * - Then launch the emergency call
     * - Retry if the call fails with an OUT_OF_SERVICE error

     * - Finally, clean up any leftover state (progress UI, wake locks, etc.)

     * the rest of the sequence is entirely serialized, and runs only on
     * the handler thread.)
